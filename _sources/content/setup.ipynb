    "# Introduction to `epidemic-intelligence`\n",
    "The `epidemic-intelligence` Python library is a user-friendly module for creating publication-ready visualizations of large-scale epidemic data stored in BigQuery. It is built on top of the `plotly` and `matplotlib` graphing libraries for easy customization and image exportation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This page explains how to install `epidemic-intelligence` and its dependencies. The rest of the documentation will explain the docstrings for the user-facing functions in this library, as well as show some example applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that none of the visualizations produced as examples in this documentation are meant to be represenatative or informative, but rather to showcase the capabilities of the library. "

Once it is done, you can confirm that `epidemic-intelligence` has been installed correctly by running:\n",
