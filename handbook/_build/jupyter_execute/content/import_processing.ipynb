    "# `importation_processing`\n",
    "`epidemic-intelligence` is designed to handle large numbers of simulations, but in order to visualize importation data, we must only have one 'run' worth of data. To facilitate this, the `importation_processing` module offers two tools for simplifying and aggregating importation data to make it ready for visualization. "

    "`method` (`str`, optional): Method used to determine how data is simplified. Must be one of:\n",
    "- `'median'` *(default)*: For each time and location, the median value across all runs will be used. A fixed-time metric. \n",

    "- `'mbd'`: Uses modified band depth to compute the most central run, then uses that run's data for all times and locations. A curve-based metric. \n",

    "The `importation_processing.aggregate_table` function is designed to be used after simplification on a table that only has one run worth of data. It allows you to aggregate by date and compartment to further customize your data for visualization. Note that many parameters carry over from the `simplify_multirun` function, but that using the same `table_name` and `destination` will cause your simplified table to be overwritten. "
